    As a user, I want to perform Add Note transaction in policy center

    @add_note_pc
    Scenario: Adding the note from the account level
        Given the user logs into the policy center as "superuser"
        When the user loads "pc" data "addNote_01" from json "AddNoteTestData"
        And the user creates personal account
        And the user adds the note
        Then the note is added successfully to account
